[Hotkeys for Arduino](http://appsforarduino.com/hotkeys)
==================

Control your Arduino with custom global keyboard shortcuts using Hotkeys for Arduino!

[Get it now on the Mac App Store!](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotkeys-for-arduino/id498494016?mt=12)


FEATURES

- Works in background
- Six customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Example sketch
- Easy to integrate into projects


WORKS GREAT FOR

- Home automation - Command what actions should happen with the hotkeys. For example: turning on/off lights in a room!
- Accent lighting - Easily control LEDs to create a mixture of colours to suit your need
- Quick testing - Experiment with different actions without having to dig through the code each time
- Live demos - Effectively communicate your project's ideas and concepts with others
- And more! - Arduino projects are only limited by your imagination! Create the next best project, and use Hotkeys for Arduino to control it.


##Usage

Hotkeys for Arduino demonstrates how you can use [Matatino](http://appsforarduino.com/matatino) to interact with your Arduino.

[Hotkeys_LEDs.ino](http://appsforarduino.com/hotkeys-dist/Hotkeys_LEDs.ino) - Here is a pre-baked example sketch that you can use to test! We have LEDs connected on pins 13-6.

Or, you can just inset this snippet of code into your existing sketch. Make sure that Serial is running at 115200 baud, and currentAction is an int.

	if(Serial.available() > 0) {
    	char c = (char)Serial.read();
    	currentAction = atoi(&c);
  	}
 
  	switch(currentAction) {
   		case 1:
      	// Action 1
      	break;
    	case 2:
      	// Action 2
      	break;
    	case 3:
      	// Action 3
      	break;
    	case 4:
      	// Action 4
      	break;
    	case 5:
      	// Action 5
      	break;
    	case 6:
      	// Action 6
      	break;
  	}

If you are going to be using Hotkeys for Arduino to build the application to use it as a standalone, then do a Tweetware micro-action on [this page](http://appsforarduino.com/hotkeys). It's an honour system, I know you'll be cool!

There aren't that many more features that you can add on to hotkeysâ€¦ maybe annoying sound effects?

:D Either way, contributions are welcome!
